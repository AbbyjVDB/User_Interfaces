Designed by George J. Klose and programmed by Mark Lesser, the game had players steer a car between three lanes to avoid oncoming vehicles while shifting gears to change speed. Its success led to other Mattel handheld hits like Football and Baseball, as well as spin-offs such as Missile Attack and Ski Slalom, and it was even cloned in the Soviet Union as Elektronika IER-01.",

Designed to compete with the Game Boy Advance, it offered phone and gaming features in one device but was criticized for its awkward design and poor button layout, earning the nickname “taco phone.” Despite a redesigned N-Gage QD model, the system sold only about 2 million units before being discontinued in 2006, though Nokia later reused the N-Gage name for a mobile gaming platform.",
